An application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. In this application the employer is prompted with an add employee button. On click they are prompted with an add first name if applicable then a last name and lastly that employees salary. Upon submission of the employee's information the employer is then prompted with an option to add another employee or not. Add as many employees as the user of this application would like. However once canceled at the new employee prompt the application will then display all the employees/salaries along with receiving back an average of all employees salaries. A little bonus is the employer will recieve back a random employee with their specific information/salary which could be used however necessary. Happy payroll tracking!
